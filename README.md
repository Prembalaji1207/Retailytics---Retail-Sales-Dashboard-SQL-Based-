# RETAILYTICS---Unlocking Retail Insights Through SQL

---

**Retailytics** is a SQL-driven retail analytics project focused on uncovering meaningful insights from transactional sales data. It involves monthly and category-wise sales analysis, identifying high-performing months, and optimizing decision-making through data.

This project showcases the application of structured query language (**SQL**) in conducting end-to-end data analysis within a retail context. Designed to reflect real-world practices employed by data analysts, it encompasses the creation and management of a relational retail sales database, the execution of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and the derivation of actionable insights through well-structured SQL queries.

Key objectives include **data exploration, cleansing, aggregation**, and the resolution of **business-centric analytical queries** related to **sales performance, seasonal trends**, and **product category behavior**. This project serves as a foundational exercise for aspiring data professionals, emphasizing core SQL competencies essential for data-driven decision-making in the retail industry.
